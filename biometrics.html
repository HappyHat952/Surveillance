                <p>You have, most likely, knowingly used biometrics before. When your phone scans your fingerprints or your face to allow you to access the device, that’s using biometric technology. But have you heard of behavioral biometrics? Antonio Villas-Boas at Business Insider explains that at this point, passwords are not enough- they work for identification, but cannot effectively authenticate as a user as passwords are too easy to hack and too easy to forget. So, in addition to passwords, websites track users’ typical behaviors, like how they move their mouse, the pages they typically visit, and how quickly they operate through the software to determine if it is them or a bad actor. Computers even detect something awry if your typical device is offline and lying horizontally, indicating that someone may be attempting to access your account as you sleep.</p>
