This is because your IP address is like your street address, but in terms of the internet. It’s a unique series of numbers that ensures that information is sent to the correct place. How does this relate to your router? Every time you visit a website on the internet, your router sends your IP address to that website. This way, the website can send its contents back to you. Once your IP address gets in the wrong hands, however, things get messy. Unsecure websites can sell your IP address to third parties or use it for nefarious purposes. This can expose your approximate location, online activity, and puts you at risk of having criminals run their activity through your router and potentially taking the fall for their crimes.</p></div>
