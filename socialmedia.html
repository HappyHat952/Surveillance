                <p>Everything you’ve ever posted (even though you don’t understand the scale of how big this is) will stay on the internet forever. Every stupid post or mistake you make is available to everyone, including friends, family, current and future employers, future landlords, banks deciding if you should get a loan, outcomes of a court case and much more. That is just people in your personal life seeing your online presence without your consent, not even how what you post can show any stranger online all your personal information. Posting anything can cause you to accidentally dox yourself.</p>
