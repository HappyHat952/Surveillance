    <p>Have you ever seen an ad that was exactly what you were looking for, before you even looked for it? And then another, that’s so perfect for a need you didn’t even realize you had? Then you have encountered targeted advertisements. These are ads that you receive based on your online behaviors and digital footprint. They’re geared towards you, based on the data collected about you, because personalized advertisements are much more effective in getting you to spend your money than ads that are irrelevant to your interests. This close monitoring of people’s web activity can feel intrusive and disturbing, so governments have set up consumer privacy laws & tech companies to allow users to opt out of this kind of tracking.</p>
